# CSBigCaptain's Word Tester

## About:

The tester is a simple and weak word tester.But it will be stronger as I grow up!

The programe was made in Python 3.10.4(Microsoft Store Edition).

## How to use:

- If you want to use the word tester,you must make sure your PC have Python environment.About how to install Python,this is not within the technical limits of this readme document.

- Runing the program,you must open cmd or powershell etc. Input these code can run the program.
  ```powershell
  python mainp.py functions.py
  ```

**<u>Warning:You must make sure the "mainp.py" "fuctions.py" and "Datas" folder in the same path.Instead the program may have problems!</u>**

- About the MainFile :
  - The MainFile files(Including MainFile.txt and MainFIle.json) are used to storage questions asked to you.And they must in the "Datas" folder.Without these files,or the files path has problems,the program may report error(As the time used to develpment is so short,so we can't make sure there will report error 100%).
  - The program have the json mode and the txt mod.The txt mode use the "MainFile.txt" file and the json mode use the"MainFile.json" file.Edit the txt file is easy but to keep the format right and starderd is a bit difficult.Maybe the little format mistake in a superbly large txt file could make you superbly sad and it is difficult to group words.So I advise you to use the json mode.Although to edit json file is difficult and troublesome,the JSON mode supports nested dictionaries, which the TXT mode cannot do.
  - <u>**Json mode warning:If a dictionary contains both dictionary and other types of data, the program will automatically skip the other types of data and keep the dictionary when reading it.**</u>

## The planning in the future:

The project's development is stopped as I have to study in school.But I still collect the advice and bugs of the program.If you have bug or advice,I superbly welcome to open an issue!

I will start the development of the program again in June and release the first Release in August.
Thanks and enjoy the project!
