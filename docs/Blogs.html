Something I want to add in the Wordtester in futuer: <br>
    1. We will add a "setting.json" in the ".\Datas",which can remember your personal settings of the programe.Yeah,I will add a new setting! <br>
    2.A new setting of the programe -- "Reinput Times".When you make a mistake in Mode A(Words mode),you must reinput the word some times which it is determined by yourself. <br>
